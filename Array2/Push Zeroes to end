You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N. You have been required to push all the zeros that are present in the array/list to the end of it.
Also, make sure to maintain the relative order of the non-zero elements.

public class Solution {  

    public static void pushZerosAtEnd(int[] arr) {
    	//Your code goes here
        int i =0;
        int k =0;
        int temp=0;
        for( i=0; i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]!=0){
             temp = arr[k];
            arr[k]=arr[i];
            arr[i]=temp;
            k++;
            }
        }
    }

}
