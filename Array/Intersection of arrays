You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. 
You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words,
when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

public class Solution{  
    
    public static void intersections(int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
    	//Your code goes here
        int n1 = arr1.length ; 
        int n2 = arr2.length ;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n1  ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < n2  ; j++){
                if(arr1[i] == arr2[j]){
                System.out.print(arr1[i] + " ");
                  arr2[j] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                  break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
