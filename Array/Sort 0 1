You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N that contains only integers, 0 and 1. Write a function to sort this array/list.
Think of a solution which scans the array/list only once and don't require use of an extra array/list.
Sample Input 1:
1
7
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
Sample Output 1:
0 0 0 1 1 1 1

public class Solution {  

    public static void sortZeroesAndOne(int[] arr) {
    	//Your code goes here
      int n = arr.length;
        int a = 0, b = n - 1;  
    while(a < b)  
    {  
        if(arr[a] == 1 && arr[b] == 0)  
        {  
           int temp = arr[a];  
            arr[a] = arr[b];  
            arr[b] = temp;  
        }  
        else if(arr[a] == 1)  
        {  
            b--;  
        }  
        else  
        {  
            a++;  
        }  
    }
    }
}
