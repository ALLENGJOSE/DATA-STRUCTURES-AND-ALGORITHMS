You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N which contains numbers from 0 to (N - 2).
Each number is present at least once. That is, if N = 5, the array/list constitutes values ranging from 0 to 3 and among these, there is a single integer value that is present twice. 
You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.
Sample Input 1:
1
9
0 7 2 5 4 7 1 3 6
Sample Output 1:
7

public class Solution{  
    
    public static int duplicateNumber(int arr[]) {
    	//Your code goes here
    int n = arr.length;
    int i;
    for(i = 0 ; i <n-1; i++ ){
    int j;
    for(j = i+1; j <n ; j++){
       if(arr[i]==arr[j]){
           return arr[i];
       }
    }
    }
    return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
}
}
