You have been given an array/list(ARR) of size N. You need to swap every pair of alternate elements in the array/list.
You don't need to print or return anything, just change in the input array itself.
Sample Input 1:
1
6
9 3 6 12 4 32
Sample Output 1 :
3 9 12 6 32 4

Code:
public class Solution {
    
    public static void swapAlternate(int arr[]) {
    	//Your code goes here
        int size = arr.length;
        for(int i = 0 ; i< arr.length - 1; i+=2){
         int start = arr[i];
         arr[i]= arr[i+1];
         arr[i+1]=start;
        }
    }
}
